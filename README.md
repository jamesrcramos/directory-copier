# Directory Copier
Created a custom directory copier for Windows machines for one of the nation's largest school photography businesses to prevent loss of image and school photo shoot files. 

Prior to this, individuals in the department had to go through the following directories in laptops to be backed up: "Desktop", "Downloads", "Documents", "Pictures", and a custom folder called "Exports" and manually pick each file to be backed up. The individual also had to create the backup folder and subfolders in the external hard drive that was to be used and move each backed-up file to its proper location. 

With this program, the backup folder and its' subfolders are created automatically using arguments given by the user through a simple user-interface. The program then crawls through each directory, filters through the files (by excluding PDFs), then copies desired files to their appropriate subfolders. 

## Built With
